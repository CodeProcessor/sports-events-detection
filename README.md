##Introduction
Sports are essential to humans; it improves the mental health and physical fitness of the body. Today sports are becoming very challenging, and humans are pushing the game to the limits. Modern technological improvements help to improve the player tactics individually and also as a team. Analyzing past games is a crucial way to improve the game-play.
Rugby is a full-contact sport where players run with a ball in their hands, which has to reach behind the opponent's goal line through a touchdown for teams to score. There are hundreds of rugby videos on the internet that can get more information about relevant teams’ tactics and strategies.  This research’s primary focus is to help the overall tactics and strategic planning with past videos, allowing players to analyze a game and instantly obtain crucial data.
Identifying the opposition team’s attacking and defending patterns is very important for players and coaches to plan the game ahead of time. One of the primary ways to get an idea is to watch a match played by the opposition team, but watching a complete match will take more than 80 minutes. It is easy if there is a way that can identify particular incidents of a match in a given video automatically.

##Research Problem
An action can be considered as a movement in human joints in a particular way. An event is a specific set piece play which happens with a result of multiple players doing multiple actions. Event recognition, which assigns video segments to a particular predefined event class, and event localization, which identifies the spatial and temporal location where an event occurs, are two main fundamental and extensively researched areas in this context. In sports video analytics, identifying specific events is a vital part. Developing a method to detect, classify, and analyze team actions in a video is essential in machine understanding in sports. The main research area is to detect the events in a broadcasted rugby video.

##Research Objectives

+ Sports Activity detection in a broadcasted video.
+ Rugby Event Localization which means find the temporal location of where the event happens in a continuous video
+ Rugby Event Recognition which is to classify the event into predefined class
